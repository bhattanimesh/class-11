Dictionaries are Python’s implementation of a data structure that is more generally known as an associative array.
A dictionary consists of a collection of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair maps the key to its associated value.

You can define a dictionary by enclosing a comma-separated list of key-value pairs in curly braces ({}). 
A colon (:) separates each key from its associated value
